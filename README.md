netcode
=======

Repository for the website http://www.netcode.io.

### Installing:

Clone the repository.

Make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed. Once you install node, use npm (node package manager) to install [bower](http://bower.io) and [grunt](http://gruntjs.com). You'll need to use the `-g` flag with npm so that it installs the packages globally.

Example:
	`sudo npm install -g bower grunt`

Inside of the project directory, run `bower install` to download all of the dependencies we'll be using (Bootstrap, JQuery, Font Awesome).
